# World_Renew_Energy
Capstone 1 Project: Are the majority of developed countries transitioning to cleaner energy?
I am curious to see how common throughout the world it is for countries to be concerned with climate change and the depletion of nonrenewable resources.

To Tell Frank:

Changing project slightly - rather than choose a population threshold for developed countries (India is less developed but very high population - getting a dataset from UN that classifies developed vs developing and using those developed countries for hypothesis - will still look at population data though)
